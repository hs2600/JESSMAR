This graph demonstrates that another real estate bubble has been created. In January 2000, the median home price in Southern California was $197,000. In January 2006, the median home price was $504,000, an increase of 155%. By January 2009, the median home price was $247,000, a decrease of 50%. In January 2014, the median home price was $404,000. Since then, the median home price has raised to $438,000 in January 2016. This is an increase of 77%, since the post peak low in January 2009. This increase is unsustainable given the fact that incomes have remained virtually flat.
