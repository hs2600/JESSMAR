This Standard & Poor’s chart demonstrates that the Price to Revenue ratio is at an extreme level and is due for a correction. The “Mean” for the last 15 years is a ratio of 1.41.  

The high ratio level of the last stock market peak in 2001 of 1.78 is where we were only a few months ago before we started to trend down to todays 1.70. During the last stock market correction March of 2009 the low ratio during this period was 0.80, all of which indicates a correction beginning to happen.
