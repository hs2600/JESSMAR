	<li>JESSMAR is a LLC formed to facilitate the acquisition, renovation, resale and rental management of undervalued properties throughout Southern California.
</li><li>JESSMAR will focus its primary efforts on Orange County, Inland Empire, and North San Diego County, and South Los Angeles County.
</li><li>JESSMAR will focus on single and multi-family residential, new builds, flips, commercial and income properties.
</li><li>Utilizing its broad and deep industry contacts within the real estate community, JESSMAR Management LLC as the Managing Member expects to locate and secure for JESSMAR undervalued properties at a discount to todayâ€™s market values.
</li><li>In addition, JESSMAR has at its disposal a full general contracting operation (JESS Development.) allowing JESSMAR to service the property renovation process internally to control time and costs.
</li><li>In the short term, the management will transact quick-turn properties to generate immediate positive cash flows: residential renovation and flip, re-use commercial, and condo conversion.
</li><li>As the market corrects, the management team will be in a very strategic position to capitalize on undervalued properties. These long term opportunities include New Builds, Apartments, Commercial, Incomplete Projects, Land, Condo Conversions, Infill Redevelopment, and Below Replacement Cost Properties with limited entry to market.
